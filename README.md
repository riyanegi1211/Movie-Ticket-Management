# Movie-Ticket-Management

Implement a simple movie ticket vending machine. The movie theater that will use the machine has only one movie and one show time each day. Every morning, the theater manager will turn on the ticket machine, and it will ask him for the name of the movie and the ticket price that day. It will also ask how many seats are in the theater (so it won't sell too many tickets). When a customer walks up to the ticket machine, he will see the name of the movie, the time, and the ticket price displayed. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad of buttons to enter a number into the "Number of Tickets" field, and a "Buy" button. Printed tickets come out of a slot at the bottom of the machine. Above the ticket slot is a message display (for error messages like "Please enter more money or request fewer tickets" or "SOLD OUT!"). An additional display shows the customer's balance inside the machine. Finally, there is a "Return Change" button so the customer can get his unspent money back.
